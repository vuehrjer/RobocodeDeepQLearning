# Overview

A robot that learns with Deep Q Learning while the hyperparameters of the Neural Network are optimized by Evolutionary Algorithms.

This project was done for the university module "Artifical Life". For further details please look at the [documentation](https://github.com/vuehrjer/RobocodeDeepQLearning/blob/master/Robocode%20Project%20Documentation.pdf) of the project.
